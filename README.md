# AI-Training-Data-Generator
This is a simple python script that uses LlamaCpp to generate training data for use in SLMs or LLMs. It generates structured input and output data, and it is saved as a CSV file. This is only for research purposes, as this will massively inbread whatever model you create using it.

To use, just run 'pip install -r requiremnets.txt' then edit the .py file to points LlammaCpp to your model. Then go nuts!
